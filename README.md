## About This Project

This project is a demonstration of **Pure AI Development**:

- **Co-created with**: Claude & Gemini
- **No Design Files**: 100% of the UI/UX, animations, and layout were generated directly via code conversation, without any Figma/Sketch mockups.
- **Pure Code**: Built entirely through natural language prompts and AI coding assistance.

## Development Process

1. **Content Drafting (1 Hour)**:
   - Wrote `bp.md` to define the business plan logic, structure, and key messaging.
   
2. **AI Implementation (5 Hours)**:
   - AI generated the complete web application based on the markdown draft.
   - Handled all visual design, responsive layouts, and complex animations via code generation.

3. **Total Cost**: < 100 RMB (Total API Token usage)
